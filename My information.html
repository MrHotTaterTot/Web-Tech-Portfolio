                    <hr>
                    <p> I am an undergraduate student in the Queen Mary
                        University of London studying to become a Machine learning Engineer.
                        I am currently on the first year of my Bachelor of science course with
                        a plan to finish it in the specialization in Artificial intelligence.
                        Further on I plan to complete my study as a Machine learning Engineer
                        as my Master's degree. I also plan on gaining more practical knowledge
                        by applying for an internship in tech based companies.
