                <p>This projects is a most basic neural network that can be done
                , so called the ABC's of machine and deep learning.
                It constructs something of a brain which goes through thousands of pieces
                of data and learns on the outcomes to make the best guess when
                given a handwritten number.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What's shown in the picture is only the small bit of the actual code.
                It's based on the class of neural network which is given a lot of data and
                each of the nodes that are constructed for each of the pixels in the image
                are given weight and an activation function then passed through a sigmoid
                function or how It was easier for me to understand a squashification function
                that changes the values of all the activation functions and weights to a value
                between 0 and 1.</p>
